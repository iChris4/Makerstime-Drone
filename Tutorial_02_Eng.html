<h4>Step 1: Illustrator </h4>
<h5>1.1 Ellipses and Alignment </h5>
<br>

<p> To begin, create a new worktop with dimensions of 100mm wide by 100mm high,
  check that the units are in Millimeters, in "Advanced" choose "Raster Effects" "High 300 ppi".<br>
  (In the version 20.1.0 or below of Illustrator uncheck the option "Align the new objects on the grid in pixels" )</p>
<br>

</video>

<br>
<p> Select the "Ellipse" tool on the left side panel while holding the mouse button on the "Rectangle" icon.<br>
Then in the window that appears, click on Ellipse <br>
(or by pressing the L key on the keyboard)<br>
(If the "Tools Panel" is not displayed, go to the top menu and click on Window > Tools > Default)<br><br>
Make a simple click on the blank page to bring up a dialog box.<br>
Enter the dimensions 71mm width and 71mm height.<br>
(The icon to the right of the dimensions boxes allow links the proportions)</p>

<img src="ressources/Tuto02PNG/Ellipse_Box.png">

<p>Change the appearance of the circle with the options at the right of the document.<br>
Next to "Ellipse" click on the first box and choose the black square,
in the box immediately to the right select the square crossed in red called "None"<br>
this allows you to obtain a transparent outline.</p>

  <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/02.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>

<p> Using the same method, create another 65 mm by 65 mm circle.<br>
This time change the color of the circle by selecting the square white color,
then in the box immediately to the right select the "None" square.<br>
Now click on the "Select" tool on the left side panel
to be able to select and manipulate the position of the circles freely.<br>
(Or by pressing the V key on the keyboard)</p>

<video  width="auto" height="600" loop autoplay muted ="true" id="video">
  <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/03.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>

<p> Display the "Align" panel by selecting from the menu bar at the top of the screen,
Clic on "Window" then on "Alignment" from the drop-down menu.
(You can freely manipulate the position of the Alignment panel above your page) </p>

<img src="ressources/Tuto02PNG/Alignement_Simple_Box.png">

  <p> We will now highlight both circles and then in the "Align" panel.
  Press the "Horizontal Align Center" button and finally "Vertical Align Center".</p>

  <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/04.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>

<p> The white circle is now in the middle of the black circle.</p>

<br><br><br>

<h5> 1.2 Square, Advanced Alignment and Pathfinder</h5>

<p> Now add a square of width 7mm and height 50mm ( color is not important ) <br>

 Align the square with the "Align" tools at the edge to the right of the black circle. <br>
To perform this action without changing the position of the circles, the additional alignment options must be displayed. <br>
To do this, click on the button at the top right of the alignment tool window:   <img src="ressources/Tuto02PNG/Options.svg" height="20"> </p>

<img src="ressources/Tuto02PNG/Options.png">

<p> Choose "Show Options"
An additional row of icons is displayed:</p>

<img src="ressources/Tuto02PNG/Alignement_Box.png">

<p> Select by holding the left mouse button, only the black circle and the rectangle.
Then choose at the bottom right of the Align Panel "Align To:" and click on "Align to Key Object".
Highlight the black circle and press the buttons :
"Horizontal Align Left" then "Vertical Align Center" in the "Align Objects" category. </p>

  <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/05.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>

<p> We will now use the Pathfinder to subtract the square from the white circle.<br>
The Pathfinder is similar to the "Group" function in Tinkercad as it allows you to perform boolean operator actions.<br><br>
The Pathfinder is by default right next to "Align" in the Panel.<br>
(If not, display the Pathfinder panel by selecting from the menu bar at the top of the screen,
"Window" then "Pathfinder" drop-down menu) </p>

<img src="ressources/Tuto02PNG/Pathfinder_box.png" height="auto" width="40%">

<p> Highlights the circle and rectangle by executing a (⇧ SHIFT + click)
  and then in the Pathfinder window use the function "Subtraction" </p>

<p> The white circle now has an indentation on the left</p>

  <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/06.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>

<p> Select the "Polygon Tool" under the "Rectangle icon" and create a 6 side polygon <br>
  In the "Transform" panel, rotate the polygon by 90° then change the W Value to 10mm and the H value to 20mm <br>
  Now align it to the left center of the white semicircle by using "Align to key object", selecting the white semicircle then click on "Vertical Align Center" and in the bottom box enter "-3mm" and finally click on "Horizontal Distribute Space" <br>
  Make sure the semi-white circle and the polygon are highlighted and use the pathfinder to subtract them together
</p>

  <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/07.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<br>

<p> The white semicircle now has a notch on the left</p>

<br><br><br>

<h5> 1.3 Saving </h5>

<p> Save the document by selecting in the top menu bar "File" then "Save As ..."

  In the dialog box, you can freely name and choose where to save your file.
  It will nevertheless be necessary to select the "SVG" type of file from the drop-down menu next to "Format".
  Then press OK

  Another dialog box appears, leaving the SVG Profile in SVG 1.1, you do not need to change the other options.
  Click OK </p>

  <br>



<br><br><br>

<h4>Step 2: Tinkercad</h4>
<br>
    <p> Import your file into Tinkercad using the button at the top right
  <br /> In import options, click on "Artboard" then enter 100mm in Length and 100mm in Width</p>

    <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/09.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <br>

<p> Change the height of the imported part to 2.00mm <br>
Add a cube 8.00mm high, 10.00mm depth by 10.00mm wide<br>
Align the 2 pieces on the flat part of the circle with the "Align" tool as seen in the previous tutorial.</p>

<video  width="auto" height="600" loop autoplay muted ="true" id="video">
  <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/10.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>

<p> Take the roof shape by scroling down in the right panel rotate it by -90° horizontally and -90° vertically. <br>
  Then give him the dimensions : 24.00mm Width, 6.50mm Length and 3.25 Heights. <br>
  He will now look like a triangle <br>
(Tip : You can click on the white box with the dimensions inside it to change the numbers with your keyboard) </p>

<video  width="auto" height="600" loop autoplay muted ="true" id="video">
  <source src="ressources/Tuto02MP4/11.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>

<p> Change the accuracy of the grid to 0.5mm <br>
Select the circle and the red box and group them together. <br>
Raise the triangle by 1.50mm and give it an incline of 8º to the outside. <br>
(To be able to modify the inclination degree by degree, after clicking on the double arrow,
you must keep the left click of the mouse pressed above the blue wheel above.) <br>
Use the align tool to put the triangle on the outside edge of the cube, then move the triangle approximately 1mm out of the cube. </p>

<p>  Select all the parts and group them together
Export the shape by selecting "Export" then STL to be able to 3D print it !</p>
